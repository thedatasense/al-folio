I am Binesh Kumar, a dynamic and experienced professional with over 15 years in the field of data science and healthcare technology. Currently, I hold the position of Senior Principal Research and Development Engineer & Technical Fellow at Medtronic. My expertise lies in enhancing healthcare solutions through innovative technologies, particularly in the realms of minimally invasive therapies and precision oncology.

Academically, I am a Ph.D. Candidate at the Secure and Assured Intelligent Learning Lab (SAIL Lab), University of New Haven, focusing on dynamic treatment planning systems for precision oncology using Reinforcement Learning Techniques. My goal is to create equitable healthcare solutions across the globe.

Passionate about bridging the gap between data and actionable insights in healthcare, I am always eager to engage in collaborations and discussions that drive innovation in medical care.
